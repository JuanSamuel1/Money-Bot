## About The Project

![project screenshot](https://github.com/JuanSamuel1/Timestamp-Microservice/blob/main/timestamp-microservice.PNG)

Creating this project is part of my backend web development learning in a course by freecodecamp. In general, this microservice will convert the time given in the parameter into either form of timestamp.
You can see the demo of the microservice in this link: https://timestamp-microservice-juan.glitch.me

The API will work like the following:
* A request to /api/:date? with a valid date should return a JSON object with a unix key that is a Unix timestamp of the input date in milliseconds
* A request to /api/:date? with a valid date should return a JSON object with a utc key that is a string of the input date in the format: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
* A request to /api/1451001600000 should return { unix: 1451001600000, utc: "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:00:00 GMT" }
* If the input date string is invalid, the api returns an object having the structure { error : "Invalid Date" }
* An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a unix key
* An empty date parameter should return the current time in a JSON object with a utc key

It is a very simple API, however, from this project I learned about how to handle GET request and intertwined between unix and utc date format.

It's exciting as well as interesting to build this microservice.That's why I want to share this project here, hope you get some lesson from the code ðŸ˜„.
