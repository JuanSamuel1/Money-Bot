## About The Project

When I saw a music bot in Discord, I thought it will be fun if I can make one. So, I decided to learn more about how to make a bot in discord and tried to make one. I stumbled in 2 choices, either using the discord package in Javascript or the discord package in Python. Since I am more comfortable in using Python, I decided to make it using Python. I tried to find many resources about the discord.py package until I finally felt ready to begin.

Making a discord bot is not easy as you imagine, however, the API provided by Discord for developers surely make it easier. I started plan on how am I gonna make the bot behave as well as created the structure of the bot. After that, I created the function one by one until it behave as I wanted. After I finished creating it, I asked my friend to give it a try and found out that there are still many flaws and bugs in the bot üò•. I patiently fixed the bugs and added new features to it. 

After all the ups and downs, I proudly present to you, the Money Bot. The idea behind this bot is a simulation of gambling without real money. So, you can actually play with your friends without being frightened of losing money. This bot includes game like guessing head or tail for a coin and higher or lower for cards, but of course, since playing the head or tail has higher risk, you are rewarded higher compared to the higher or lower. In the future, I really hope can add more games to this bot and create more advancement to increase user experience. I know that this bot isn't perfect, hence, any feedbacks, flaws, or bugs is highly appreciated. Lastly, I hope you like the game and create a fun experience playing with your friend üòä.

To start with, type ";info" to read all the rules and ";init" to create an account (You will be rewarded $1000 for the initial balance). That's it, you're good to go. Happy Gambling üåù.

A nice tip from me: Play hard, gamble hard ! It's not like gonna hurt you that much if you lose :)
